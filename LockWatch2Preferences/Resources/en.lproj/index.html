			<h2>Version 2.0b3-u1</h2>
			<p><small>July 2020</small></p>
			
			<p>After you had to wait for it (way too long), the first update for LockWatch 2 Beta 3 is here. Including general improvements (more on that later), this update includes the "big 5" Weather complications. Here's a list of every complication added in this update:</p>
			
			<ul>

				<li>Weather Conditions</li>
				<li>Wind</li>
				<li>Air Quality Index (AQI)</li>
				<li>UV Index</li>
			</ul>
			
			<p>Additionally, this update contains the following bug fixes and improvements:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					Complications are finally useful! Supported complications will now open their assigned app or invoke their assigned actions.
					<ul>
						<li>Battery: Tapping will toggle Low Power Mode</li>
						<li>Date: Opens the Calendar app, showing today's events</li>
						<li>Now Playing: Opens the app that's currently playing music</li>
						<li>Weather complications will open the Weather app showing current conditions</li>

						<li>World Clock: Opens the Clock app and shows configured world clocks</li>	
					</ul>
				</li>

				<li>Adds layout compatibility for <a href="cydia://package/com.cemck/photon">Photon</a>.</li>
				<li>Adds support for video-based watch faces (beta). Required assets won't be shipped with LockWatch 2.</li>

				<li>You can now select between "Off", "Translucent" or "Solid Black" as the watch face background.</li>
				<li>Fixes a crash that occured when selecting a system language or changing "Bold Fonts".</li>
				<li>Fixes layout issues on iPhone in landscape mode.</li>

				<li>Improves the appearance of the "Customize"/"Cancel" buttons for Apple Watch Series 4/5.</li>
				<li>Adds "preferenceloader" as a dependency. I guess it's common law to always forget that.</li>
				<li>Improvements to the zoom animation when selecting a watch face.</li>
				<li>Improvements to localization.</li>
				<li><strong>For developers</strong>: Compiled for arm64 and arm64e with an iOS 11.2/13.3 hybrid SDK on High Sierra (see <a href="https://github.com/SniperGER/iOS13-Private-SDK">https://github.com/SniperGER/iOS13-Private-SDK</a> for more details)</li>
			</ul>
			
			<p><strong>Currently known issues:</strong></p>
			<ul>
				<li>Weather complications are currently not compatible with iPad due to missing frameworks.</li>
				<li>The "UV Index" complication may cause layout issues when used with the "Infograph Modular" face. This does, in fact, also happen without LockWatch as a data source. thx apple.</li>
				<li>Weather complications may not be updated automatically after restarting.<br><strong>Workaround</strong>: Load weather data using the stock "Weather" widget and display LockWatch again.</li>
				<li>Some weather conditions may be displayed with incorrect colors. This issue is caused by Apple, and fixing it requires a lot of work.</li>

			<h2>Version 2.0b2</h2>
			<p><small>March 25, 2020</small></p>
			
			<p>LockWatch 2 Beta 2 is a complete rewrite of Beta 1. While Beta 1 was just focussing on getting things up and running and showing what's possible in future builds, Beta 2 has been developed from scratch, mostly to fix existing bugs and add new features. So much has changed actually, I may not be able to provide a full changelog.</p>
			
			<ul>
				<li>Completely rewritten from scratch, using the iOS 13 SDK. Which also means every device that uses an A12 processor or later is supported now. Basically.</li>
				<li>Drastically reduced battery drain.</li>
				<li>Preferences: Selected watch faces won't reset and you can select which Apple Watch you want to emulate, if you want to emulate one at all.</li>
				<li>Watch face management: Add, reorder or remove watch faces right from the lock screen. Also, you can reset watch faces to system defaults now.</li>
				<li>Customization: Customize any supported watch face to your taste. Again, right from the lock screen.</li>
				<li>"Watch" integration (limited to iPhone): Sync the watch faces on your lock screen with those on your physical watch, including customization. Or add new watch faces from the "Watch Faces" tab.</li>
				<li>So. Many. Layout fixes. In fact, every layout issue in Beta 1 (as far as I know) has been fixed, and there's almost no glitching whatsoever (at least while I was testing it).</li>
				<li>Did I mention that battery drain has been drastically reduced?</li>
			<ul>
