			<h2>Version 2.0b2</h2>
			<p><small>March 25, 2020</small></p>
			
			<p>LockWatch 2 Beta 2 is a complete rewrite of Beta 1. While Beta 1 was just focussing on getting things up and running and showing what's possible in future builds, Beta 2 has been developed from scratch, mostly to fix existing bugs and add new features. So much has changed actually, I may not be able to provide a full changelog.</p>
			
			<ul>
				<li>Completely rewritten from scratch, using the iOS 13 SDK. Which also means every device that uses an A12 processor or later is supported now. Basically.</li>
				<li>Drastically reduced battery drain.</li>
				<li>Preferences: Selected watch faces won't reset and you can select which Apple Watch you want to emulate, if you want to emulate one at all.</li>
				<li>Watch face management: Add, reorder or remove watch faces right from the lock screen. Also, you can reset watch faces to system defaults now.</li>
				<li>Customization: Customize any supported watch face to your taste. Again, right from the lock screen.</li>
				<li>"Watch" integration (limited to iPhone): Sync the watch faces on your lock screen with those on your physical watch, including customization. Or add new watch faces from the "Watch Faces" tab.</li>
				<li>So. Many. Layout fixes. In fact, every layout issue in Beta 1 (as far as I know) has been fixed, and there's almost no glitching whatsoever (at least while I was testing it).</li>
				<li>Did I mention that battery drain has been drastically reduced?</li>
			<ul>

			<p>Welcome to the very first beta of LockWatch 2!</p>

			<p>Please note that nothing is currently considered finished and is subject to change. This release also disables iPad support for now, since there is currently no proper way for this package to download required files.</p>

			<ul>
				<li>High battery drain</li>
				<li>No preferences (selected face resets after restarting SpringBoard)</li>
				<li>No watch face management (add/remove/reorder)</li>
				<li>No complication support</li>
				<li>Missing transitions</li>
				<li>Video/picture based faces don't show anything</li>
				<li>Probably a lot of layout issues</li>
			</ul>
